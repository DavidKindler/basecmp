		<p>NXP is a global company and the consistent implementation of our company identity is essential if we’re to present a unified image to the market.</p>
		<p>In recent years, NXP has greatly evolved as a company, and continues to grow in both size and significance. The NXP brand too, has developed, with a distinct personality and visual identity that reflects our vibrant culture and customer-focused passion to win.</p>
		<p>Our brand is much more than our three color lettered logo; it is one of our most valuable assets. Our brand identity is an expression and reflection of our culture, values, attitude, products, solutions but also how we ‘look and feel’. Strong corporate branding ensures that we are recognized, remembered and respected.</p>
		<p>We can only build a strong corporate identity if we all know what we are about and express that consistently over time.</p>
