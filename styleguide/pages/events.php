                    <p class="tocable" data-toctitle="Home (top)">We must make a strong impact at exhibitions, trade fairs and events. Our displays should be clearly distinguished from those of other companies.</p>
					<p>These design specifications are for the creation of NXP stands for exhibitions, conferences and trade shows. For smaller shows, elements from the following can be adapted, but the look and feel should always remain the same.</p>
                    <p>For events where NXP is co-exhibiting with another, independent part of NXP (such as NXP Software), the primary NXP logo should take prominence over the independent NXP logo. Please note that only approved NXP logos may be used.</p>
                    <h3>Floor</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li>Raised floor maximum 150mm high, top finished in a wood print laminate white maple or light-colored carpet </li>

                    <h3>Walls</h3>
                    <ul><li>Outside walls should be made up of both curved and flat wall parts:</li>

                    <li class="secondli">Curved walls approximately 250mm thick, finished in white spay paint inside and out </li>
                    <li class="secondli">Flat walls approximately 250mm thick, finished in white spray paint inside or printed fabric outside (NXP logo or pictures from the existing image bank – Marcom Shop) </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Fabrics, even when they’re on walls, should always be backlit for the most eye-catching look possible</li>
                        <li>Flat wall provided with a 450mm high plinth, with white light underneath</li>
                        <li>Part of the outside walls should be finished in the NXP company colors</li>

White floodlights used in the outline part, to light the sprinkler cloth. The fronts are built in a height of between 1250mm and 2000mm, and finished in printed fabric (NXP logo and tagline). The stand’s entire ceiling should be suspended from the ceiling of the hall</li>
                        <li>Ceilings in meeting rooms: White laminated 100mm high coves provided with some halogen spots for general lighting on the conference tables</li>

                   <ul>
                       <li>Demo set-up in white laminated cupboards with stainless steel legs. Doors and side panels in MDF spray painted in high gloss white. Top with a 100mm    high front, in MDF spray painted in high gloss white</li>
                        <li>Reception desk and bars in a look that’s simple, smooth and modern. Finished in high gloss white spray paint and optional glass tops</li>
                        <li>Central high-standing tables made of MDF and spray painted in the three NXP company colors on stainless steel feet</li>
                        <li>Rental furniture should be used for the general meet and greet areas and the meeting rooms. Think:</li>
                        <li class="secondli">Meeting rooms with black chairs and anthracite tables (preferably in an elliptical shape)</li>
                        <li class="secondli">Meet and greet area with white lounge chairs, white bar stools and white tables</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Most of the decoration should be printed on the light box construction in the outside walls all around the booth, and on the front side of the ceiling eye-catcher above the booth</li>
                        <li>The inside of the booth should show several NXP logos in the meet and greet area, and the meeting rooms</li>
                        <li>To create brand impact and to ensure that the booth is easily recognized from a distance, display the NXP logo as large as possible on all sides. In this instance the “clear space” guideline around the logo can be ignored in favor of increasing prominence</li>
