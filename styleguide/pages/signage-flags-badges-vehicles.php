				<h3 class="tocable">Building signage</h3>
				<div class="print-text-column">
					<p>A good signage system is visible, readable, appropriate and presents us with a good opportunity to communicate a clear brand identity. Ensure the quality of the signage we use around buildings is appropriate for a world-class company.</p>
	                <h3>Signage types</h3>


					<p>Use either high level signs for advertising or routing signs for buildings and sites.</p>
					<p>Sites have approved processes for designing, contracting, placing, maintaining (and removing) signs. Approach one of our preferred suppliers with a clear brief based on your requirements and the signage guidelines. Once the signs have been installed, agree upon maintenance contracts for assigning responsibility for signage maintenance and a procedure for signage removal and disposal.</p>

					<h3>High level signs</h3>
					<p>The main purpose of high level signs is to advertise the brand. The logo is the only element that can be used on a high level sign. They are placed on buildings or advertising masts. Mounted on a roof or on the wall of a building, they should stand out and be clearly visible from a distance.</p>

					<p>High level signs should ideally only be placed at so-called ‘A locations,’ such as next to central highways, city centers, main ports (airports, train stations), etc. The definition of an ‘A location’ differs from country to country.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="print-text-column">
					<p>For more details on this subject please refer to outdoor media companies and our preferred suppliers.</p>
                   	<p>A high level sign can also be placed to emphasize the importance of the building but preferably only for company, divisional or country headquarters. The advertising objective remains valid and should be taken into account to position the sign in the most effective place.</p>
                   	<p>Signs should be as large as the space allows, without being over-bearing. Branding should continue throughout the site with all other signs bearing the NXP logo. For more details on this subject please refer to outdoor media companies and our preferred suppliers. </p>
					<h3>Routing signs</h3>
					<p>Routing signs are placed on or near sites and buildings for navigation to the appropriate building, department or room. They should be clear to all visitors and employees by providing confirmation of arrival and guidance to the correct destination. Routing signs can also be used to inform the visitor about site rules or special situations. However, they should never be used to communicate information that could also be addressed in another form; the less signs, the better.</p>

					<h3 class="tocable">Locations</h3>
					<p>The following four situations are relevant when specifying a signage system:
					<ul>
						<li>An NXP site: More than one building on an NXP owned site; only NXP tenants; at least one gate to enter the site </li>
						<li>A multi-tenant site: More than one building; not all owned or occupied by NXP; at least one gate to enter the site. (Note: the site/building may well have its own overall signage system) </li>
						<li>An NXP building: An NXP owned/rented building; only NXP tenant(s); the building can be standalone or located on an NXP  or multi-tenant site </li>
						<li>A multi-tenant building: A building in which NXP is	one of the tenants but occupies one or more floors. (Note: the site/building may well have its own overall signage system) </li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>Responsibility</h3>
					<p>Issues of responsibility are locally controlled. Generally, facility management, site management and/or country/local brand management will commission the acquisition of signage. Responsibilities should be defined
					clearly before a supplier is contacted.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="print-text-column">
					<h3>Methodology</h3>
					<p>Routing signs should only be placed at decision spots. A letter or number code for buildings is preferred to departmental/ organizational names to avoid the cost of adapting to organizational changes.</p>
					<p>The following directional structure for outdoor routing should be followed: <br />
					<img src="/content/signage-flags-badges-vehicles/up.jpg" />		&emsp;	Arrow indication: straight on <br />
					<img src="/content/signage-flags-badges-vehicles/right.jpg" />	&emsp;	Arrow indication: to the right <br />
					<img src="/content/signage-flags-badges-vehicles/left.jpg" />	&emsp;	Arrow indication: to the left
					</p>
					<p>Within each directional indication the destinations should be shown in alphabetical order rather than the order of approach. The standard size of letters for outdoor signs is 60mm, which is easy to read on sites with a speed limitation of 30km/h. In exceptional cases, the preferred supplier is able to recommend deviations from the standard letter height.</p>
